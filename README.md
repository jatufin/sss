# Simple Script Security

This was a little hobby project back in the day, when the idea of encrypting and decrypting web page contents inside the browser, using just a scripting language, was somewhat novel. The usual way to protect your data was to use Apahe Access Control (that is, `.htaccess` file) over unsecured HTTP connection. Needless to say, _that_ was not secure at all. If I remember correctly, SSS was downloaded by thousands, so it was not totally futile attempt to gain immortality.

This repository is for historical curiosity only. An artifact from Dotcom bubble era. Do not use for anything serious.

There is also a rude encrypted message board made in PHP. For everything that is dear and pretty in this world, do not put it online without upgrading to modern standards.
